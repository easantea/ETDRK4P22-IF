# ETDRK4P22-IF
ETDRK4P22-IF is a fourth-order ETD Runge Kutta Scheme for solving semilinear parabolic PDE. The scheme uses dimensional splitting to improve the run time for multidimensional problems. 
This repository contains MATLAB codes for running specific 2D test problems used to verify convergence of the scheme.
